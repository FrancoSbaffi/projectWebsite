            <h1 class="title1">The lightest linux distributions</h1>
            <img class="banner-img" src="../../img/roadmap/LinuxD.png" alt="">
            <p class="sub-title">Choosing the ideal Linux distribution for your needs can be challenging due to the hundreds of options available.</p>
            <p class="sub-title">For example, some Linux distributions are made with beginners in mind, while others are built for advanced users. Also, some specialized Linux distributions are built for particular purposes.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1 class="title1">Lighter Linux distributions</h1>
            <div class="more-low-padding">
                <h2 class="sub-title">1. Lubuntu</h2>
                <img src="../../img/roadmap/lubuntu.png" alt="" class="banner-img">
                <p class="sub-title">Lubuntu is an open source Linux distribution based on Ubuntu that claims to be fast and lightweight. It is available on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">Although the developers no longer reveal the exact minimum hardware requirements on the official website, Lubuntu is still considered the best Linux distribution for older computers. A minimum of 256 MB of RAM and 8 GB of available disk space is recommended to run the basic Lubuntu desktop environment.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">Despite its energy efficiency, Lubuntu is a powerful Linux distro as it is based on the latest version of Ubuntu. As a result, it is highly compatible with Ubuntu software and repositories. This allows users to access thousands of applications and packages available through the Lubuntu Software Center.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">The system comes with a number of lightweight apps pre-installed, such as Trojita and Skanlite. Lubuntu uses lightweight desktop environments like LXDE and LXQt, which help minimize resource usage.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">One thing to note before using Lubuntu is that it has a simple and straightforward system interface with a low screen refresh rate. On the other hand, Lubuntu is a great option if you prefer a clean looking desktop for your machine.</p>

                <img src="../../img/roadmap/LinuxLite.png" alt="" class="banner-img">
                <p class="sub-title">Linux Lite is an open source operating system based on the Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) release series. We recommend this lightweight distro for Windows users considering switching to a Linux-based operating system.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">To make the transition from other operating systems as seamless as possible, Linux Lite comes with a Windows-like desktop environment and is compatible with preconfigured and additional familiar apps like Spotify, Skype, and Firefox.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">Other than that to run, Linux Lite doesn't require too many resources, as it employs custom Xfce as its lightweight desktop environment. It also offers a memory compression tool called zRAM that allows fast performance on older machines.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">Also, Linux Lite has a built-in Lite Tweaks application that is used to clean and fix problems within the operating system.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">The minimum hardware requirements for this Linux distro include <strong>1 GB</strong> of RAM and a <strong>1 GHz CPU </strong> with two or more cores. The system does not support 32-bit architectures and is only available for 64-bit platforms.</p>

                <img src="../../img/roadmap/antiXLinux.png" alt="" class="banner-img">
                <p class="sub-title">antiX is a fast, easy to install and lightweight Debian-based Linux distribution for Intel-AMD x86 compatible systems. It is totally free of systemd.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">This Linux distribution supports both new and old machines with its antiX Magic feature. It provides a powerful kernel and Debian-compatible applications, regular updates, and repositories. antiX uses SpaceFM as its default desktop environment.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">The antiX interface is based on the GTK+ toolkit and uses IceWM as a window manager. The distro is compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. antiX can also be used on a fast boot rescue CD and works fine running live from a USB stick, with or without persistent file storage.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">antiX runs smoothly with <strong>256 MB</strong> of RAM and its installer requires at least <strong>5 GB</strong> of available disk space. It comes in four downloadable versions:</p>
                <p class="sub-title"><span class="yellow-point">•</span><strong>  Full:</strong> Contains the full range of applications.</p>
                <p class="sub-title"><span class="yellow-point">•</span><strong>  Base:</strong> Allows users to choose their application suites.</p>
                <p class="sub-title"><span class="yellow-point">•</span><strong>  Core:</strong> Gives users full control over the installation.</p>
                <p class="sub-title"><span class="yellow-point">•</span><strong>  Net:</strong> Same as Core version but without default desktop environment.</p>
